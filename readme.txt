Automatically corrects instances of the word Pokemon to Pokémon in your post content and titles.

== Description ==

Automatically corrects instances of the word Pokemon to Pokémon in your post content and titles, as well as other Poké-terms like Poké Ball and Pokédex. 

If you run a Pokémon website, this is an invaluable plugin if you're picky about your accented E's.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `pokemon-accented-e` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin magically fix non-accented Poké E's? =

Basically, it does a search and replace. It goes through your content and if it sees for example the term *Pokemon*, it will then replace it with *Pokémon*.

= What are all the Poké-terms it fixes? =

* Pokemon
* Any term that begins with Poke and a space like "Poke Ball" (and subsequently if you captialize the word "Poke" as in to prod someone, that will be Poké-fied as well, so try not to do that)
* Pokedex
* Pokegear
* PokeNav

More terms can be added in future releases. [Contact me](mailto:adam@pkmncards.com) if you have requests!

= Where is the configuration page? =

There is none. Once you activate the plugin, it's up and running. Disable it to turn it off.
